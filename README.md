# Security-of-Systems-and-Networks-Labs
Security of Systems and Networks - Labs
Welcome to the repository for Security of Systems and Networks labs! This repository contains the labs, reports, and source code for various hands-on experiments in securing systems and networks. These labs cover a wide range of topics, from basic cryptographic algorithms to setting up secure networks with OpenVPN, ensuring a solid understanding of practical cybersecurity concepts.

Lab Overview
This repository contains multiple labs, each focusing on different aspects of system and network security. Below is an overview of the labs you’ll find in this repository:

Labs List:
Lab 1 - Firmware Databases & SHIM
Focuses on understanding firmware databases and the concept of SHIM (Secure Hypervisor Interface), as well as learning how to mitigate firmware vulnerabilities.

Lab 2 - RSA
A hands-on exercise to learn about RSA encryption. You'll generate RSA key pairs, encrypt/decrypt data, and explore the importance of Random Number Generators (RNG) in cryptographic systems.

Lab 3 - OpenVPN
This lab covers the setup of a secure VPN connection using OpenVPN. You’ll configure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), generate certificates, and use TLS for secure communications between clients and servers.

Folder Structure Breakdown:
README.md: Each lab contains its own README.md file with a detailed explanation of the lab’s objectives, tasks, and key takeaways. These files also provide guidance on how to run and configure the lab.
Lab_Report_X.pdf: Each lab has an associated PDF report that provides a deeper dive into the lab’s technical steps, findings, and conclusions. You can review the report to understand the detailed methodologies and results from each lab.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:
To run the labs, you will need some basic tools and environments. Most labs are platform-independent but may require the installation of tools like:

Linux-based OS (preferably Ubuntu or Kali Linux)
VirtualBox / VMware (for lab environments requiring virtual machines)
Docker (for containerized environments in some labs)
OpenVPN 
Each lab’s README.md file includes detailed instructions on setting up the required environment and any dependencies.
