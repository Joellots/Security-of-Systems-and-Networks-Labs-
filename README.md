# Security-of-Systems-and-Networks-Labs
Security of Systems and Networks - Labs
Welcome to the repository for Security of Systems and Networks labs! This repository contains the labs, reports, and source code for various hands-on experiments in securing systems and networks. These labs cover a wide range of topics, from basic cryptographic algorithms to setting up secure networks with OpenVPN, ensuring a solid understanding of practical cybersecurity concepts.

Lab Overview
This repository contains multiple labs, each focusing on different aspects of system and network security. Below is an overview of the labs you’ll find in this repository:


Labs List:
Lab 1 - Firmware Databases & SHIM
Focuses on understanding firmware databases and the concept of SHIM (Secure Hypervisor Interface), as well as learning how to mitigate firmware vulnerabilities.

Lab 2 - RSA
A hands-on exercise to learn about RSA encryption. You'll generate RSA key pairs, encrypt/decrypt data, and explore the importance of Random Number Generators (RNG) in cryptographic systems.

Lab 3 - OpenVPN
This lab covers the setup of a secure VPN connection using OpenVPN. You’ll configure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), generate certificates, and use TLS for secure communications between clients and servers.


Prerequisites:
To run the labs, you will need some basic tools and environments. Most labs are platform-independent but may require the installation of tools like:

Linux-based OS (preferably Ubuntu or Kali Linux)
VirtualBox / VMware (for lab environments requiring virtual machines)
Docker (for containerized environments in some labs)
OpenVPN 
Each lab’s README.md file includes detailed instructions on setting up the required environment and any dependencies.



Key Learnings
The labs in this repository aim to:

Provide hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools and techniques.
Teach the fundamentals of encryption, VPNs, and network security.
Help you understand the importance of system hardening, intrusion detection, and security testing.
