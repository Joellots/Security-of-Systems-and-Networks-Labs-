# Lab 1 - Firmware Databases & SHIM

## Objective:
The purpose of this lab was to investigate the UEFI firmware's secure boot mechanism, extract certificates, and analyze the shim bootloader's structure and security.

## Tasks Covered:
- **Task 1**: Firmware Databases and Certificate Extraction
- **Task 2**: SHIM Bootloader Analysis
- **Task 3**: Signature Data Extraction from SHIM Binary

The lab involved using tools such as `efitools`, `mokutil`, `openssl`, and others to interact with UEFI, verify secure boot, and analyze the certificates involved.
